(* Simple mutation testing framework for Coq.

   A Gallina expression [a] with a mutant [b] can be written
   as follows:

       a mutant! b        (* anonymous mutant *)
       a mutant: "bug" b  (* explicitly named "bug" *)

   In an interactive session, those expressions both reduce to
   [a] (mutations are ignored).

   Multiple mutants [b1, ..., bn] for the same expression can be
   specified, either anonymous or explicitly named
   ([mutant!] and [mutant: name] are left-associative):

       a mutant! b1 mutant! ... mutant! bn
       a mutant: "firstbug" b1 mutant! b2

   In extracted OCaml code however, those mutations can be
   selected via the environment variable [QC_MUTANT]. *)

(* - If [QC_MUTANT] is empty, the program executes normally,
     without mutations.
   - If [QC_MUTANT=DISCOVERY], the program executes normally,
     but also writes identifiers for reachable mutants into
     a file [./qc-mutants].
   - If [QC_MUTANT=(mutantid)] where [(mutantid)] is one of those
     identifiers, the program executes using that mutation.

   A typical usage is to run the program once with [DISCOVERY]:

       $ QC_MUTANT=DISCOVERY ./MyTestProgram

   Then we can test each mutant using [xargs]:

       $ cat qc-mutants|xargs -I {} -n 1 env QC_MUTANT={} ./MyTestProgram

   Mutants can also be enumerated statically by looking for the
   [__POS__] token in the extracted OCaml source code.

   The script [quickchick-expectfailure] (under [scripts/]) can be used to
   ensure a QuickChick test fails.

       $ cat qc-mutants|xargs -I {} -n 1 env quickchick-expectfailure ./MyTestProgram {}

 *)

(* Sections

   Mutants can be grouped under a common section declared as a
   [Local Instance] of the [section] type class.

       Local Instance this_section : section := "ThisSection"%string.

   Then mutants where that instance is visible will be named as
   [ThisSection:mutant_name] (instead of [:mutant_name] by default).
 *)

(* Gotchas:
   - Definitions should not be simplified using [Eval], since that
     simplifies the mutants away.
   - Mutants should not be nested: in [a mutant! (b mutant! c)],
     [c] will not be discoverable.

   Other issues:
   - [quickChickTool], being text-based, can do a richer set of
     mutations more conveniently:
     + Changing the type of an expression
     + Operations that can't be easily described at the granularity
       of expressions, for example, modifying branches of [match]
       or changing an infix symbol.
